These are my personal reflections on the evolution of development workflows for data science and AI projects. I am summarizing my experience with Docker, WSL, and HPC environments, and how to progressively scale up from local prototyping to large-scale computation.

# 📈 Complete Progressive Development Path

Starting Point: Docker Template  
         ↓  
Phase 1: Local development on macOS  
         ↓ (when GPU is needed)  
Phase 2: WSL + Linux Docker + CUDA  
         ↓ (when large-scale computation is needed)  
Phase 3: HPC Cluster + Apptainer

# 🔄 Detailed Technical Evolution

## Phase 1: Local Prototyping on macOS

docker template → adjust Python packages → run business logic on macOS  
docker/run-macos.sh → http://localhost:8888/lab  
- ✅ Rapid idea validation  
- ✅ Focus on business logic  
- ✅ 5-minute environment setup

## Phase 2: GPU Support (if needed)

macOS → SSH connection → WSL/Linux → Docker + CUDA → GPU acceleration  
VS Code Remote-SSH → Windows WSL → docker/run-linux.sh  
- ✅ Accelerated GPU training  
- ✅ Cross-platform team collaboration  
- ✅ Linux environment compatibility testing

## Phase 3: Large-Scale Computation on HPC Cluster

macOS → SSH → vera2 → Docker to Apptainer conversion → submit-job.sh → compute node  
VS Code → vera2.c3se.chalmers.se → apptainer/ → sbatch → vera-r0x-xx  
         ↑                                                        ↓  
   Port forwarding ←────────── VS Code PORTS panel ←──────────── Jupyter Lab  
- ✅ Access to large-scale computing resources  
- ✅ Long-running job support  
- ✅ Professional HPC environment

# 🎯 Key Transition Points

Docker → Apptainer Conversion

# Docker (local)
FROM python:3.10  
RUN pip install packages  
CMD ["jupyter", "lab"]  
↓  
# Apptainer (HPC)
Bootstrap: docker  
From: python:3.10  
%post  
   pip install packages  
%runscript  
   exec jupyter lab "$@"

Connection Method Evolution

Local: Direct access to localhost:8888  
WSL: SSH tunnel macOS → WSL → localhost:8888  
HPC: SSH tunnel macOS → vera2 → compute node:random port

# 🚀 Technical Stack Evolution Summary

| Phase    | Environment            | Connection Method   | Use Case                  |
|----------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Phase 1  | Docker + macOS        | Direct access       | Prototyping, small-scale  |
| Phase 2  | Docker + WSL/Linux    | SSH → WSL           | GPU training, cross-platform collaboration |
| Phase 3  | Apptainer + HPC       | SSH → cluster       | Large-scale computation, production deployment |

# 💡 Core Value Summary

The elegance of this logic:
1. Progressive complexity: Only increase technical complexity when truly needed
2. Environment consistency: Docker/Apptainer ensures cross-platform code compatibility
3. Connection reuse: macOS serves as the unified development entry point, SSH as the universal connection method
4. Technical debt management: Each phase solves the most important problem at that stage

# Final outcomes:
- 🎯 One codebase, runs in multiple environments
- 🎯 Unified development experience (all via Jupyter Lab)
- 🎯 Flexible resource allocation (local → GPU → HPC)
- 🎯 Optimal cost-effectiveness (upgrade as needed)
