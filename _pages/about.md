Interdisciplinary researcher using **emerging technologies** to create **meaningful experiences for people**.

Currently, my research explores game studies knowledge discovery, completion, and utilization through AI/ML, with the aim of enabling explainable and accessible game design.

My ongoing work develops along three directions:
- **Computationalizing Game Design Knowledge**: Building AI-friendly knowledge bases of game design principles and patterns (ontologies, knowledge graphs, knowledge discovery).

- **Explainable & Generative Game Development**: Creating AI systems that transform high-level design intent (e.g., “make a platformer like Super Mario Bros.”) into interpretable, playable code in engines such as Godot.

- **User-Centered AI for Games**: Designing AI tools to support diverse users (designers, educators, domain experts) and purposes (creativity, education, health), ensuring accessibility and transparency.
