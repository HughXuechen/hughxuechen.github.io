Interdisciplinary researcher using **emerging technologies** to create **meaningful experiences for people**.

Currently, I am working on game studies knowledge discovery, completion, and utilization through AI/ML for explainable and accessible game design. Three work-in-progress specifically:

- **Building Game Design Knowledge Bases**: Creating AI-friendly databases of game design patterns and principles.

- **AI-Powered Game Development**: From idea to code: Tell my AI “Make a game like Super Mario Bros.” — it generates playable code in Godot.

- **User-Centered AI Systems**: Designing AI tools for diverse goals — education, health, creativity — and diverse users, from designers to domain experts.
