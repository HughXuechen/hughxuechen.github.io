**I explore the interdisciplinary impact of game technologies.**  

Currently, I work on **AI, game design, and computational creativity**— I structure knowledge into graph-based models, build generative systems to support game designers.

> "A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."
