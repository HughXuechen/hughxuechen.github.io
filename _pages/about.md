I am an interdisciplinary researcher interested in emerging digital technologies, especially their socio-technical affordances. My (blur) vision is to create stand-alone autonomous worlds entangling digital and physical entities. I hope these worlds can bring more options to the people - jobs, leisure, lifestyles, etc.

Driven by this vision, I am investigating the following technologies (with priority):

1. **Computational creativity driven by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)**. ML/AI enables the general automation which can benefit my exploration in other fields. Also, computational creativity would make it easier for me to come up with innovative ideas.
2. **Game Design**. Games invite voluntary engagement from users. And games have already made great virtual worlds.
3. **Blockchain/Non-fungible Tokens(NFT)**. Blockchain/NFT grant scarcity to digital beings which creates value (and maybe life).
4. **Virtual Reality (VR)/Augmented Reality (AR)**. Both VR and AR can serve as an entrance or invitation to the worlds.
