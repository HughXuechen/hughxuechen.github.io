#### Exploring AI, game design, and computational creativity through structured knowledge and generative systems.

---

My research focuses on **structured knowledge** and **generative systems** in game technologies.

- **Structured knowledge** formalizes **game design patterns, mechanics, and AI frameworks** into graph-based models, such as **Neo4j-powered Game Design Patterns databases**, providing **data-driven insights** for computational creativity.  
- **Generative systems** leverage **LLMs, procedural generation, and AI tools** to support game design and storytelling. I develop **Godot plugins and AI-driven frameworks** that integrate these systems, enabling new creative possibilities.
