> "Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible."  
> — Richard Feynman 


Interdisciplinary researcher using emerging technologies to create meaningful experiences for people.

**My work combines game studies, AI/ML, and gameplay design, focusing on human-computer interaction and computational creativity**.

- **Building Game Design Knowledge Bases**: Creating AI-friendly databases of game design patterns and principles.

- **AI-Powered Game Development**: "I want to make a game like Super Mario Bros." - Tell my AI this, and it generates Godot game engine code for you.

- **User-Centered AI Systems**: Designing AIs for diverse users and purposes (e.g., general game design, game for education and health promotion).
