**I explore the interdisciplinary impact of game technologies.**  

Currently, I work on **AI, game design, and computational creativity**— in three specific aspects:

- Ontological Game Design Knowledge Engineering.
- Machine Learning for Game Knowledge Validation and Discovery.
- Natural Language-driven Game Content Generation in Game Engines.
