Interdisciplinary researcher focused on leveraging emerging technologies to create practical benefits for people. **My current work bridges game studies, AI and machine learning, and gameplay design, emphasizing human-computer interaction and computational creativity**. 

- **Computationalizing Game Studies Knowledge**: Constructing AI/ML-friendly game design knowledge bases by integrating existing ontologies and design pattern datasets. 

- **AI-Driven Integrated Game Development**: Building upon these knowledge bases to create a comprehensive generation pipeline that enables natural language gameplay description generation and automated code generation in game engines (primarily Godot). 

- **Iterative Refinement through User-Centered Evaluation**: Deploying the generated content and development tools in educational and practical contexts, then leveraging user feedback, experience evaluation, and impact assessment to iteratively improve both the knowledge base and the generation tools.
