**Work in Progress**

Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in machine learning and deep learning, have significantly impacted various domains, including game design. This study revisits the 2014 call for "computational game creativity" in light of these developments. We present an overview of AI's application in game design, focusing on its potential for computational creativity. Through a systematic literature review, we investigate the current status of AI in game design, the prevalence of creativity-related discussions, and how creativity and computational creativity are conceptualized and evaluated in this context. Our analysis examines the relationship between authors' discussions and existing theories of creativity. This overview aims to provide insights into the intersection of AI, game design, and computational creativity, contributing to the ongoing dialogue in this rapidly evolving field.
